C,Potential Indirect Corelating Data Points (Proxy Variables for Financial Inclussion),Expected correlation,Why it matters,Typical sources,Notes
1,Mobile phone ownership / smartphone penetration,Positive (↑ Device Access → ↑ Use of Digital Finance),The on‑ramp to DFS; Findex 2025 and sector studies consistently tie connectivity to usage. ,ITU,
2,Affordability of data (cost of 2GB as % GNI),Negative,High data costs depress DFS adoption and sustained use; affordability gaps are steep across Africa.,ITU,
3,Gender gap in account ownership/usage,Negative (gap ↑ → inclusion ↓),"Persistent gender gaps flag structural constraints (ID, phone, norms) and require tailored design; Ethiopia exhibits deep gaps.",ESS,
4,Agent Network Density (agents per 10k adults + agent activity rate),Positive (↑ Agent Density → ↑ Usage),"For low‑income and rural areas, agents are the interface of financial inclusion, cash‑in/out, registration, customer support. Weak agent networks = low digital usage.",FSD,
5,Urbanization / Population Density (especially market‑center density),Positive (↑ Density → ↑ Inclusion),"Dense or semi‑dense economic zones have better network coverage, more merchants, more agent points, and more economic activity, driving faster DF adoption.",,
4,Mobile internet usage (% of adults),Positive,"Captures effective connectivity, not just network availability.",ITU,
5,4G/5G population coverage (%),Positive,Measures supply-side readiness for high-quality digital services.,ESS,
6,Adult literacy rate (%),Positive,"Low literacy constrains onboarding, product understanding, and consumer protection, increasing reliance on assisted or agent-based models.",,
7,Digital literacy rate (% of adults),Positive,Shows the population’s ability to use digital tools safely and independently.,,
8,Employment rate (%),Positive,Links digital adoption to income flows and use cases.,,
9,Electricity access (% of population),Positive,A non-negotiable infrastructure input for digital inclusion.,,
10,Average hours of power outages per month,Negative,"Captures quality of electricity supply, not just access. Frequent outages undermine service reliability, merchant acceptance, and consumer trust in digital channels.",,
11,Rural population with mobile internet access (%),Positive,Measures equity of digital inclusion.,ITU,
12,E-commerce users (% of adults),Positive,Indicates advanced digital usage and ecosystem growth.,,
13,Adults with national digital ID (%),Positive,"Enables scalable, low-cost onboarding and KYC.",National Id authority,
14,Government payments digitized (% of G2P flows),Positive,Digitized G2P payments drive account usage and serve as an entry point for first-time users.,,
