D,Naunces and Market Contexts (Theme),What to watch,How It Shows Up in the Market,Implications for Baselines & Programs,Evidence / Sources,Notes
1,P2P Dominance in Ethiopia,Digital payment rails vs. merchant acceptance,"Unlike global norms where P2P is mostly for transfers, in Ethiopia actual payments (e.g., goods/services) often occur on P2P rails","When benchmarking Ethiopia on “digital payments,” global frameworks may understate real usage; baselines should differentiate P2P for transfers vs. P2P for commerce etc.",,
2,Mobile Money-Only Users Are Extremely Rare,Penetration of mobile money-only accounts,"In Ethiopia, only ~0.5% of adults have mobile money without a bank account, unlike many SSA markets where mobile money is the primary inclusion driver",Global assumptions that mobile money is the main on-ramp don’t hold in Ethiopia; baselines should segment “bank-only” vs “mobile money-only” vs “both”,,
3,Bank accounts are easily accessible,Comparision of the requirements to open a financial account in Ethiopia with other countries,,,,
4, Very Low Formal Credit Penetration (Even by African Standards),,,Customer onboarding without credit is easy; building credit products is hard.,,
